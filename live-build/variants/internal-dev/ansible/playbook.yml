    # In order for LDAP to work properly, we need a specific ordering of the
    # values contained in the "passwd" line of the "/etc/nsswitch.conf" file.
    # Essentially, we need the "delphix" value to always be last. Thus, we
    # need to ensure the virtualization package is installed after the LDAP
    # specific configuration has been applied; we acheive this goal by
    # applying this LDAP role first, and then the virtualization specific
    # roles later.
