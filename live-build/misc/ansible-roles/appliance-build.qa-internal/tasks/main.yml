# We would ideally limit the build dependencies to the "internal-dev" variant.
# However, we want to use the "internal-qa" variant to do pre-push testing, and
# we currently do pre-push testing by building the code under test on the
# Delphix Engine (and changing this workflow would require a significant amount
# of work). As a temporary workaround, we install the build dependencies on the
# "internal-qa" variant. In the long term, we should change the pre-push jobs to
# do builds on a separate bootstrap VM rather than on a Delphix Engine. Then we
# can move the build dependencies from the list below back into the
# "internal-dev" playbook.
