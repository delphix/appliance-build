# delphix-platform installs ntp in a disabled state by default.
# We want to enable ntp to keep the time in sync on DCenter as clock skew
# can cause operational problems.
#
# For example, we run awscli on DCenter hosts, and some preliminary searching
# shows that aws s3 commands can return RequestTimeTooSkewed errors if there
# is clock skew.
#
# We also have cleanup jobs that run on DCenter hosts that rely on filesystem
# timestamps being accurate.
