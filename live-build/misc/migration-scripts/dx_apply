# [1] We place vmlinuz and initrd from our migration image into
#     the /boot directory of the current system, so the bootloader
#     can load them.
# [2] Add a new option in the bootloader's menu for Linux. This is
#     done by appending the configuration of the new option in our
#     current menu file.
#
# Note: We reverse sort below based on a vmlinuz & initrd's name
# to get the latest version of them. In reality, there is always
# only one version but in the case that there is an issue in
# how we construct the images we always want to get the latest.

# This command loads the Linux Kernel Compressed Executable in memory
# from the OK prompt of the FreeBSD bootloader. Note that we pass it the
# lxcmdline variable, which will be parsed by the bootloader. The reason
# why we create a separate variable for the cmdline arguments instead of
# just adding them in-line is because otherwise the command would be
# greater than 256 characters and fail to be parsed by the bootloader.
# We have to be careful to escape ${lxcmdline} properly so that it is
# not resolved by the current script.

# Essentially we want the command line to be as close as possible to
# what is set by our grub configuration for fresh Linux installs. Our
# customizations to the grub command line can be found in the
# delphix-platform project at etc/default/grub.d/override.cfg.
# Here is an overview:
#
# - We specify the root filesystem type to be ZFS and its root dataset
#   the one that we just created for the migration image.
#
# - We carry-over the following settings from delphix-platform:
#   console, ipv6 and crashkernel.
#
# - We specify zfsforce=1 because otherwise we would be failing at
#   pool import because of ZFS's hostid check. This argument is added
#   specifically for the migration case and doesn't appear on a fresh
#   Linux install.
#
# Note that we use an array of strings instead of one whole string
# that we break to multiple lines in order to divide the arguments
# in logical pieces while ensuring that their quotes are escaped
# correctly and in accordance with our linters/checkstyles. This
# should be taken into account for all cases of string arrays for
# the rest of this file that have to do with adding commands in the
# bootloader configuration.
