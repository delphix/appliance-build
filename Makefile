# There doesn't appear to be a way to have "shfmt" return non-zero when
# it detects differences, so we have to be a little clever to accomplish
# this. Ultimately, we want "make" to fail when "shfmt" emits lines that
# need to be changed.
#
# When grep matches on lines emitted by "shfmt", it will return with a
# zero exit code. This tells us that "shfmt" did in fact detect changes
# that need to be made. When this occurs, we want "make" to fail, thus
# we have to invert grep's return code.
#
# This inversion also addresses the case where "shfmt" doesn't emit any
# lines. In this case, "grep" will return a non-zero exit code, so we
# invert this to cause "make" to succeed.
#
# Lastly, we want the lines emitted by "shfmt" to be user visible, so we
# leverage the fact that "grep" will emit any lines it matches on to
# stdout. This way, when lines are emitted from "shfmt", these
# problematic lines are conveyed to the user so they can be fixed.
