# This script is intended to build an upgrade image that contains all of
# the packages needed to upgrade a particular variant of the appliance,
# whichever platform it is running on. The upgrade image is a tar
# archive whose primary component is an Aptly/APT repository containing
# a version of the delphix-entire package for each supported platform
# and all of its dependencies. This repository is created by taking and
# combining all the deb.tar.gz tarballs produced by live build for this
# variant (of which there will be one per supported platform).

# appliance versions were built (making sure that we built for at least
# one platform), and build an upgrade image from that.

# Generate the "payload" of the upgrade image, which will contain the
# upgrade scripts, as well as the Aptly/APT repository. We generate this
# "payload" tarball as a way to limit the number of files that we need
# to checksum and store in "upgrade image" tarball itself. Rather than
# the "upgrade image" tarball containing all of the files for the upgrade
# scripts and APT repository, it'll only contain the "payload.tar.gz"
# file, and a few other miscellaneous metadata files.
#
# We need to limit the files contained in the 'upgrade image" tarball
# because the signing service that we use to sign the SHA256SUMS file
# below, has a relatively small limit on the size of the file that we
# can sign with it. Thus, we need the contents of the SHA256SUMS file to
# be realtively small (and that file's size grows linearly with the
# number of files contained in the "upgrade image" tarball).
