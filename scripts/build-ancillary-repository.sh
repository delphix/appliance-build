# This script is intended to be used to build the "ancillary" repository
# that is used when we run live-build to build our artifacts. Prior to
# running live-build to build any of the appliance variants, this
# ancillary repository must be created using this script.
#
# The ancillary repository is a directory containing an Aptly/APT
# repository that can be used as the root directory to "aptly serve".
# Further, this repository will contain all of the "first-party"
# packages produced by Delphix, such that they can be easily installed
# (and/or downloaded) via the live-build environment with normal APT
# commands (e.g. apt install, apt download, etc).

#
# The first-party packages produced by Delphix are stored in Amazon S3.
# Thus, in order to populate the ancillary repository with these
# packages, they must be downloaded from S3, so they can be then
# inserted into the Aptly repository.
#
# Here, we determine the URI of each of the first-party packages, and
# then use these URIs to download the packages later. Making this
# determination is a little complex, and is dependent on the policy set
# forth by the teams producing and storing the packages.
#
# With that said, there's three main methods of influencing the URI from
# which the packages are downloaded:
#
# 1. If the package specific AWS_S3_URI environment variable is provided
#    (e.g. AWS_S3_URI_VIRTUALIZATION), then this URI will be used to
#    download the package. This is the simplest case, and enables the
#    user of this script to directly influence this script.
#
# 2. If the package specific AWS_S3_PREFIX environment variable is
#    provided (e.g. AWS_S3_PREFIX_VIRTUALIZATION), then this value is
#    used to build the URI that will be used based on the default S3
#    bucket that is used.
#
# 3. If nether the package specific AWS_S3_URI nor AWS_S3_PREFIX
#    variables are provided, then logic kicks in to attempt to
#    dynamically determine the URI of the most recently built package,
#    and then uses that URI. This way, a naive user can not set any
#    environment variables, and the script will work as expected.
