# Delphix Appliance Upgrade

This directory contains the code used to upgrade an Ubuntu-based Delphix
Appliance, leveraging common Ubuntu packaging tools such as `dpkg(1)`,
`apt-get(8)`, `debootstrap(8)`, and others. It is capable of consuming
an "upgrade image", and using this image to upgrade an existing Delphix
Appliance; the upgrade image's are produced by the appliance build.

## Purpose

The main goal(s) of upgrade are the following:

1. Enable the upgrade of all packages on a given appliance, using only
   the upgrade image (these scripts are contained in the upgrade image);
   once the upgrade image is present on the appliance, no other network
   connectivity is required.

2. Prevent upgrade failures from occuring, since a failure can result in
   the appliance being left in a degraded, and sometimes unrecoverable,
   state. We accomplish this by verifying upgrade, prior to actually
   executing the upgrade.

3. Enable all packages to be upgraded without requiring a downtime; e.g.
   without requiring a reboot. While we've accomplished this, in that
   all packages can be upgraded without a reboot, certain software
   requires a reboot in order to run the new software delivered by the
   upgraded package(s). For example, even though we can install a new
   kernel package without a reboot, we need to reboot in order to start
   using the software delivered by that new kernel package.

## Quickstart

Run this command on "dlpxdc.co" to create the VM used to do the upgrade:

    $ dc clone-latest --size DATABASE_LARGE dlpx-trunk $USER-trunk

Log into that VM using the "delphix" user, and run these commands:

    $ download-latest-image internal-dev
    $ sudo unpack-image internal-dev.upgrade.tar.gz
    $ sudo /var/dlpx-update/latest/upgrade -v in-place
