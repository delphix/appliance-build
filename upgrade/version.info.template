# This file is consumed by the upgrade logic contained in the "execute"
# upgrade-script (contained in this repository) and the virtualization
# application (contained in an external repository). It's used to easily
# identify the contents of the upgrade image (e.g. the product version
# contained), as well as define the types of upgrade that should be allowed
# (and/or disallowed) based on the currently installed version of the
# product/appliance executing the upgrade.
#
# Note, changes to this file should be done with caution. This file must be
# able to be consumed by old versions of the virtualization application, so
# any changes to this file need to be backwards compatible, or risk breaking
# upgrade for these old versions of the product.

# The product (i.e. virtualization) version contained in the upgrade image.

# The minimum product version an engine must have installed, in order to
# upgrade using this upgrade image.
#
# If the installed version of the appliance before an upgrade, is less than
# this version, upgrading the appliance using this upgrade image is not
# allowed. This sets a bound on the old product version(s) that an upgrade
# image has to be compatible with, and is typically set to be 2 major
# versions behind the latest version.
