#
# First make sure delphix-platform-<platform> is installed. This package
# is a dependency of delphix-entire-<platform> and would be installed
# even if we just directly installed delphix-entire-<platform>. However,
# there are problems related to virtual packages that arise if we just
# directly install delphix-entire-<platform>. In particular, if
# delphix-entire is installed first, the following can happen (using
# AWS as the example for the platform on which the upgrade is being
# done):
#
#  - We run 'apt-get install delphix-entire-aws'
#
#  - Apt sees delphix-entire-aws relies on delphix-virtualization, so it
#    marks that package and its dependencies for installation. One of
#    its dependencies is the virtual package delphix-platform.
#
#  - Apt sees that there are multiple concrete packages which provide
#    the delphix-platform virtual package. It chooses one of these
#    arbitrarily, say delphix-platform-kvm.
#
#  - Apt marks all of the transitive dependencies of
#    delphix-platform-kvm for installation, including, say,
#    linux-image-4.15.0-1028-kvm.
#
#  - After finishing processing the dependencies of
#    delphix-virtualization, Apt continues processing the other
#    dependencies of delphix-entire-aws, including delphix-platform-aws.
#
#  - Apt sees that delphix-platform-aws conflicts with
#    delphix-platform-kvm, so it un-marks delphix-platform-kvm for
#    installation, allowing delphix-platform-aws to satisfy
#    virtualization's dependency on delphix-platform instead. However,
#    it does _not_ unmark all of the dependencies of
#    delphix-platform-kvm, so some unnecessary kvm-related packages end
#    up being installed, such as linux-image-4.15.0-1028-kvm.
#
# In short, we can end up with some unwanted packages installed because
# Apt marked and then unmarked some package for installation while
# trying to satisfy a dependency on a virtual package.
#
# To avoid this we install the delphix-platform-<platform> package that
# we want before installing delphix-entire-<platform>. If some
# delphix-platform package is already installed, that dependency is
# already satisfied and Apt doesn't need to choose an arbitrary one to
# satisfy the dependency.
#
# In general, we don't want upgrade to need know too much about the set
# of packages to be installed. However, it seems reasonable to make an
# exception for delphix-platform because delphix-platform is a
# fundemental piece of the architecture of the appliance. Among other
# things, it is the mechanism that we use to orchestrate the installation
# all of the platform-dependant bits of the appliance.
